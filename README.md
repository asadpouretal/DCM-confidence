This repository is for the analysis performed in "Effective connectivity predicts distributed neural coding of perceptual decision confidence, uncertainty and speed."  
You need to install SPM12 and EEGLAB toolboxes or copy in the path for these toolboxes in getParameters.m.  
Please download the open dataset from (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002739/versions/1.0.0) and adjust the paths and parameters accordingly in getParameters.m.  

For fMRI analysis, run "main_script_for_fMRI.m".  
For EEG-DCM analysis, run "main_script_for_EEG_DCM.m".
